# 📑 Introduction

Ten True Or False is an open source platform to create short quizzes with only 10 questions and only true or false answers, to be shared and solved by the community.


# 🧩 Inspiration

The idea is inspired by the technical evaluation platforms that currently exist in the market and combined with the simplicity and challenge that puzzle games provide.
